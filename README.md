# Jira Ticket Attachments
Extracts attachments from Jira tickets

This script connects to a jira server and retrieves the attachments of all the tickets of the defined projects. Attachments are stored in a directory named with the key of the
ticket. E.g. for a project ABC, all the attachments from the ABC tickets will be downloaded under ABC/ABC-X where X is the number of the ticket.
There are two options to execute the script a) use the executable file or b) use the source code.
